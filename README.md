## Aggie Code of Honor
An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do.<br>
This project represents many hours of hard work. Plagiarizing my project for your own grade not only goes against the Aggie Code of Honor, but it is detrimental to your education. Respect yourself, the University, and my work by following the Code.
